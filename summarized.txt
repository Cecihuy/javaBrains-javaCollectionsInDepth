The equals contract
* Reflexivity
    an object should be equal to it self
* Symmetry
    if x is equal to y, then y should also be equal to x
* Transitivity
    if x is equal to y and y is equal to z, then x should also be equal to z
* Consistency
    should return the same result unless the state of the object has been modified
* Non-nullity
    an object should never be considered equal to null
